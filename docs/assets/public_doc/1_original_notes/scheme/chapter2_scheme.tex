\section{DEFINITION OF SCHEME}

\begin{definition}[scheme, morphism of schemes]
	A scheme is a locally ringed space $(X, \ms{O})$ such that for every point $x \in X$, there is an open neighbourhood $U_x$ containing $x$ so that $(U_x, \ms{O}\vert_{U_x})$ is an affine scheme. Morphism of schemes is morphism of locally ringed spaces.
\end{definition}

We obtain the category of schemes, denoted by $\Sch$

\begin{definition}[scheme over $S$]
	Let $S$ be a scheme, the category $(\Sch / S)$ of schemes over $S$ is the category where an object is a morphism of schemes $X \to S$ and a morphism is a morphism of schemes $X \to Y$ so that $X \to S$ factors through $Y$ by the map $X \to Y$
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tikzcd}
			X \arrow[rr] \arrow[rd] &   & Y \arrow[ld] \\
			& S &             
		\end{tikzcd}
	\end{center}
	
	The collection of morphisms from $X \to S$ into $Y \to S$ is denoted by $\Hom_S(X, Y)$. If $S = \Spec A$, we also call scheme over $S$ as scheme over $A$
\end{definition}

Since $\Spec \Z$ is a terminal object in the category of schemes, the category of schemes is canonically equivalent the category of schemes over $\Z$ \note{(proof for $\Spec \Z$ is terminal in next section)}

\section{MORPHISM INTO AFFINE SCHEMES, GLUING OF MORPHISMS}

\begin{definition}[open subscheme]
	Let $(X, \ms{O}_X)$ be a scheme and $U \subseteq X$ be an open subset. Then, the locally ringed space $(U, \ms{O}_{X}\vert_U)$ is a scheme and we call it an open subscheme of $X$. If the 
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
	Let $X$ be a scheme and $U, V$ be affine open subschemes of $X$. Then for every $x \in U \cap V$, there exists an open subscheme $W \subseteq U \cap V$ containing $x$ such that $W$ is principal open in $U$ as well as in $V$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proposition}[gluing of morphisms]
	Let $X, Y$ be locally ringed spaces. Then $U \mapsto \Hom(U, Y)$ sending open subset $U \subseteq X$ into the set of morphisms $(U, \ms{O}_X\vert_U) \to (Y, \ms{O}_Y)$ is a sheaf of sets on $X$.
\end{proposition}

In other words, if $X = \bigcup_i U_i$ is an open covering, then a family of morphisms $U_i \to Y$ glues into a morphism $X \to Y$ if and only if the morphisms coincide on intersections $U_i \cap U_j$ and the resulting morphism $X \to Y$ is uniquely determined.

\note{TODO - proof idea - one can identify the morphism by map between stalks, it feels local hence gluable}

\begin{proposition}
	Let $X$ be a locally ringed space and $Y = \Spec A$ an affine scheme. Then, the natural map
	\begin{align*}
		\Hom(X, Y) &\to \Hom(A, \Gamma(X)) \\
		(f, f^\flat) &\mapsto f^\flat_Y
	\end{align*}
	is a bijection.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
	\note{(TODO - use lemma above to prove for the case X is a scheme, full proof in EGAInew 1.6.3)}
\end{proof}

$\Spec \Z$ being terminal object in the category of schemes follows this proposition. Moreover, when $A = \Gamma(X)$, there corresponds to $\id_{\Gamma(X)}$ a morphism
$$
	c_X: X \to \Spec \Gamma(X)
$$

which we call canonical.
