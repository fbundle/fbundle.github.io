\begin{abstract}
The study is conducted to build a machine learning model to predict Australia rain. Adopted from previous works, we used standard techninques in exploratory data analysis and feature engineering to learn from data. We made use of day, month, year features instead of date since they appeared to affect the weather strongly. Moreover, we introduced two new classes of features: direction embedding and time information. Direction embedding is a technique to map direction data into euclidean space that better preserves the distance between close directions. Time information includes past data into current prediction that has its own advantages and disadvantages. In order to tackle a large number of features, we used \textit{XGBoost} to select the best 10 features while maintaining high performance.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
\label{introduction}
\textit{Rain in Australia} is a dataset containing ten years of observation in several locations in Australia. This study contains an intensive exploration of data, feature engineering and modelling the dataset to predict whether it will be raining tomorrow given all previous data.

\section{Related Work}
On \textit{Kaggle}, \textit{Rain in Australia} was studied by many people. Majority of these methods consider this problem as classifying whether it will rain tomorrow based on the collected data today together with feature engineering to build the prediction model.

In \textit{Extensive Analysis - EDA + FE + Modelling} \cite{prashant111}, the authors did Extreme Value Analysis for variables that have distribution close to normal and Interquartile range for skewed distribution to remove the detectable outliers. Furthermore, to deal with incomplete data, they filled those missing values by the corresponding median.

In \textit{Rain Prediction using seven popular models} \cite{chandrimad31}, they made use of  \textit{MICE} algorithm \cite{mice} to impute missing data points. Although the set of features is not perfectly independent, the authors proceeded to build the model with all features after examining the importance of each feature using the filter method and wrapper method.

\textit{Time Series Analysis on Australian rain} \cite{sudhakordassubeen} introduced a time-series perspective to the problem. In the findings, one noteworthy point is the very high correlation between rain today and rain tomorrow.

Even though the previous methods successfully produced a very good performance, some techniques might improve the performance of models. We have conducted experiments on two additional feature sets: direction-embedding and time information.

\section{Exploratory Data Analysis and Feature Engineering}

\subsection{Target feature}
The target feature is of the categorical type containing Yes, No, and NaN. Since NaN has no actual meaning in our study, we dropped all entries with NaN in the target.
 
\subsection{Categorical features}
We have six categorical features in total including \textit{Location}, \textit{Date}, \textit{RainToday}, \textit{WindGustDir}, \textit{WindDir9am}, \textit{WindDir3pm}. Following previous works, we encoded \textit{Date} as a combination of \textit{Day, Month, Year} since the weather in real life typically depends on which month and which it is currently. For direction features (\textit{WindGustDir}, \textit{WindDir9am}, \textit{WindDir3pm}), we used \textit{direction-embedding} that maps direction onto a unit circle.

\subsubsection{Location}
Different locations might have different rain characteristics. Figure \ref{fig:location} shows the distribution of rain probability over all locations. Some locations have a very low rain probability such as Woomera (202 raining days in 2990 records), while others have a very high rain probability such as Portland (1095 raining days in 2996 records). Hence, \textit{Location} is a key features for our model.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{location.png}
\caption{distribution of rain probability in different locations}
\label{fig:location}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Day Month Year}

Following previous works, we replace \textit{Date} by the combination of \textit{Day}, \textit{Month} and \textit{Year}. In figure \ref{fig:year} and \ref{fig:month}, \textit{Year} and \textit{Month} appears to be directly related to the rain probability.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{year.png}
\caption{number of raining days in different years}
\label{fig:year}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{month.png}
\caption{number of raining days on different months}
\label{fig:month}
\end{figure}

Despite the fact that \textit{Day} is not directly related to the probability of rain, we still added \textit{Day} to the feature set since the independence can be explained by the high frequency. \textit{Day} alone might not be a factor affecting the rain on the next day, but some combination of \textit{Day} and \textit{Month} might.

\subsubsection{Rain Today}
RainToday is an important feature to our prediction in an obvious way. As rain usually lasts for several days. So that most of the data points lie on sequences of rainy days and sequences of sunny days. Therefore, rain is a state that is not likely to change switch. The figure \ref{fig:raintoday} demonstrated our intuition.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{raintoday.png}
\caption{number of raining days given the previous day}
\label{fig:raintoday}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Wind Direction}
For the same reason as \textit{Location}, different wind directions have their different effects on rain tomorrow, as shown below. The count of rainy days appears to be a sine wave along the direction, especially \textit{WindGustDir} and \textit{WindDir3pm}. Therefore, we imposed the use of \textit{direction-embedding} for wind direction as the following.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{windgustdir.png}
\caption{number of raining days given wind gust direction}
\label{fig:windgustdir}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{winddir3pm.png}
\caption{number of raining days given wind diretion at 3pm}
\label{fig:winddir3pm}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Direction-Embedding}

Our goal is to embed direction into Euclidean space that better preserves the closeness between directions. We mapped each direction into a point on the unit circle and introduced two new features associated with the angle formed by that direction and a base direction (we used East as our base direction), namely DirSin and DirCos.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{direction-embedding.png}
\caption{direction-embedding}
\label{fig:direction-embedding}
\end{figure}

A direction feature is now embedded into a two-dimensional space and treated as numerical features.

\subsubsection{Missing data issue}

To deal with missing data in categorical features, we imputed those records with missing data by their respective most frequent value (mod).

\subsection{Numerical features}

We have 16 numerical features \footnote{MinTemp, MaxTemp, Rainfall, Evaporation, Sunshine, WindGustSpeed, WindSpeed9am, WindSpeed3pm, Humidity9am, Humidity3pm, Pressure9am, Pressure3pm, Cloud9am, Cloud3pm, Temp9am, Temp3pm} together with 6 new direction-embedding features corresponding to 3 direction features \footnote{WindGustDir, WindDir9am, WindDir3pm}.

We plotted the distribution of features with respective to different target variables. Humidity at 3pm appears to be the feature changes the most if the target feature switches between raining and sunny.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{humidity.png}
\caption{Humidity at 9am and 3pm}
\label{fig:humidity}
\end{figure}

All numerical features follow a normal distribution loosely so that we did not perform any transformation on any field.

\subsubsection{Correlation between numerical features}

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{correlation.png}
\caption{Correlation between numerical features}
\label{fig:humidity}
\end{figure}

In the correlation matrix, we did not observe any highly correlated pair of features, and all of them have some effects on the target feature. Hence, we decided not to discard any features.

\subsubsection{Missing data issue}

To deal with missing data in numerical features, we imputed those records with missing data by their respective median.

\subsubsection{Outlier removal}

For outlier detection and removal, we have used IQR and capped those values outside the chosen range.

\subsection{Time Information}

Similar to the effects of analyzed features, the features in one day before the observation day somewhat contributed to our target variable. As shown in the figure \ref{fig:rainyesterday} below, the rain on Wednesday is not only affected by the observation on Tuesday but Monday.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{rainyesterday.png}
\caption{number of raining days given the previous day}
\label{fig:rainyesterday}
\end{figure}

Therefore, we included yesterday observations into our feature set. This change made number of features doubled, so in the next section, by using XGBoost, we overcame the issue by select only a small fraction of feature set. 

\section{Models and Evaluation}

\subsubsection{Evaluation Metrics}

Since the problem is binary classification, we chose AUC as the performance metric to evaluate the model. This metric eliminates the need for fine-tuning classification threshold.

\subsubsection{Model and Hypothesis Testing}

As mentioned earlier, the two hypotheses of the study are (1) the effect of direction embedding and (2) the effect of time information. Additionally, we want to select a small fraction of feature set due to the large number of features after adding time information.

\paragraph{Logistic Regression}

We chose logistic regression due to its deterministic nature. In logistic regression, we selectively added/removed some features and measured the performance (AUC) of the model with K-fold cross-validation and oversampling for imbalance labels. Firstly, we chose the baseline as the model with current day data. Then, we removed direction features and direction-embedding features. Finally, we added yesterday data into input features.

\begin{center}
 \begin{tabular}{||c c||} 
 \hline
  model & AUC \\ [0.5ex] 
 \hline\hline
 baseline & 0.8647 \\ 
 \hline
baseline - direction & 0.8648 \\
 \hline
baseline - direction embedding & 0.8637 \\
 \hline
baseline + yesterday data & 0.8697 \\
 \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

In the results from logistic regression, removing direction-embedding reduced the AUC score and adding yesterday data improved the AUC score. Surprisingly, removing categorical direction actually increase the AUC score. Categorical direction seems to be very bad for logistic regression.

\paragraph{XGBoost with hyperparameter search}

In the second experiment, we firstly used XGBoost \cite{Chen:2016:XST:2939672.2939785} on the whole dataset to find the feature importance \footnote{Top 15 features: Humidity3pm, RainToday, WindGustSpeed, Sunshine, Cloud3pm, Pressure3pm, Rainfall, WindDir3pmSin, Location, WindDir9amSin, WindDir3pmCos, Humidity3pm1daybefore, Month, WindGustDirCos, WindGustDirSin}

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{importance.png}
\caption{feature importance (unsorted)}
\label{fig:importance}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{importance_sorted.png}
\caption{feature importance (sorted)}
\label{fig:importance_sorted}
\end{figure}


In the top 15 features, there is no occurrence of any direction feature. Additionally, for all 3 direction features \footnote{WindGustDir, WindDir9am, WindDir3pm}, direction embedding features are more likely to have higher feature importance.

After that, we perform search on the hyperparameter space as follow: number of features [1, 10], number of trees [50, 100], tree max depth [2, 5], L1 norm regularization [0, 1], L2 norm regularization [0, 1]. We ran Bayesian Optimization for 50 iterations and finally got the AUC of 0.8820 where the hyperparameters at number of features 10, number of trees 95, tree max depth 5, L1-norm regularization 1.0 and L2-regularization 1.0. Comparing with the performance on all features of XGBoost, the result of using only 10 features was very close to the actual all features model of AUC 0.8922.

\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

In conclusion, we have demonstrated a slightly better performance using direction embedding and time information from the dataset. Furthermore, we selected the ten best features and achieved a performance very close to all features performance using XGBoost, which reveals those most important features related to rain in Australia. One might predict the rain tomorrow with relatively high accuracy using some simple features such as humidity at 3 pm and whether it is raining today.

For future work, we have planned to solve the problem with other methods such as frequency-based methods and neural network methods, which can be better in handling time-series data since the current day, month, year using a fixed frequency that might not be true in the real world

% Submission to ICML 2019 will be entirely electronic, via a web site
% (not email). Information about the submission process and \LaTeX\ templates
% are available on the conference web site at:
% \begin{center}
% \textbf{\texttt{http://icml.cc/}}
% \end{center}

% The guidelines below will be enforced for initial submissions and
% camera-ready copies. Here is a brief summary:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Submissions must be in PDF\@.
% \item The maximum paper length is \textbf{8 pages excluding references and
%     acknowledgements, and 12 pages including references and acknowledgements}
%     (pages 9 through 12 must contain only references and acknowledgements).
% \item \textbf{Do not include author information or acknowledgements} in your
%     initial submission.
% \item Your paper should be in \textbf{10 point Times font}.
% \item Make sure your PDF file only uses Type-1 fonts.
% \item Place figure captions \emph{under} the figure (and omit titles from inside
%     the graphic file itself). Place table captions \emph{over} the table.
% \item References must include page numbers whenever possible and be as complete

% \item Do not alter the style template; in particular, do not compress the paper
%     format by reducing the vertical spaces.
% \item Keep your abstract brief and self-contained, one paragraph and roughly
%     4--6 sentences. Gross violations will require correction at the

% \end{itemize}

% \subsection{Submitting Papers}

% \textbf{Paper Deadline:} The deadline for paper submission that is
% advertised on the conference website is strict. If your full,
% anonymized, submission does not reach us on time, it will not be
% considered for publication. There is no separate abstract submission.

% \textbf{Anonymous Submission:} ICML uses double-blind review: no identifying
% author information may appear on the title page or in the paper
% itself. Section~\ref{author info} gives further details.

% \textbf{Simultaneous Submission:} ICML will not accept any paper which,
% at the time of submission, is under review for another conference or
% has already been published. This policy also applies to papers that
% overlap substantially in technical content with conference papers
% under review or previously published. ICML submissions must not be
% submitted to other conferences during ICML's review period. Authors
% may submit to ICML substantially different versions of journal papers
% that are currently under review by the journal, but not yet accepted
% at the time of submission. Informal publications, such as technical
% reports or papers in workshop proceedings which do not appear in
% print, do not fall under these restrictions.

% \medskip

% Authors must provide their manuscripts in \textbf{PDF} format.
% Furthermore, please make sure that files contain only embedded Type-1 fonts
% (e.g.,~using the program \texttt{pdffonts} in linux or using
% File/DocumentProperties/Fonts in Acrobat). Other fonts (like Type-3)
% might come from graphics files imported into the document.

% Authors using \textbf{Word} must convert their document to PDF\@. Most
% of the latest versions of Word have the facility to do this
% automatically. Submissions will not be accepted in Word format or any
% format other than PDF\@. Really. We're not joking. Don't send Word.

% Those who use \textbf{\LaTeX} should avoid including Type-3 fonts.
% Those using \texttt{latex} and \texttt{dvips} may need the following
% two commands:

% {\footnotesize
% \begin{verbatim}
% dvips -Ppdf -tletter -G0 -o paper.ps paper.dvi
% ps2pdf paper.ps
% \end{verbatim}}
% It is a zero following the ``-G'', which tells dvips to use
% the config.pdf file. Newer \TeX\ distributions don't always need this
% option.

% Using \texttt{pdflatex} rather than \texttt{latex}, often gives better
% results. This program avoids the Type-3 font problem, and supports more
% advanced features in the \texttt{microtype} package.

% \textbf{Graphics files} should be a reasonable size, and included from
% an appropriate format. Use vector formats (.eps/.pdf) for plots,
% lossless bitmap formats (.png) for raster graphics with sharp lines, and
% jpeg for photo-like images.

% The style file uses the \texttt{hyperref} package to make clickable
% links in documents. If this causes problems for you, add
% \texttt{nohyperref} as one of the options to the \texttt{icml2019}
% usepackage statement.


% \subsection{Submitting Final Camera-Ready Copy}

% The final versions of papers accepted for publication should follow the
% same format and naming convention as initial submissions, except that
% author information (names and affiliations) should be given. See
% Section~\ref{final author} for formatting instructions.

% The footnote, ``Preliminary work. Under review by the International
% Conference on Machine Learning (ICML). Do not distribute.'' must be
% modified to ``\textit{Proceedings of the
% $\mathit{36}^{th}$ International Conference on Machine Learning},
% Long Beach, USA, 2019.
% Copyright 2019 by the author(s).''

% For those using the \textbf{\LaTeX} style file, this change (and others) is
% handled automatically by simply changing
% $\mathtt{\backslash usepackage\{icml2019\}}$ to
% $$\mathtt{\backslash usepackage[accepted]\{icml2019\}}$$
% Authors using \textbf{Word} must edit the
% footnote on the first page of the document themselves.

% Camera-ready copies should have the title of the paper as running head
% on each page except the first one. The running title consists of a
% single line centered above a horizontal rule which is $1$~point thick.
% The running head should be centered, bold and in $9$~point type. The
% rule should be $10$~points above the main text. For those using the
% \textbf{\LaTeX} style file, the original title is automatically set as running
% head using the \texttt{fancyhdr} package which is included in the ICML
% 2019 style file package. In case that the original title exceeds the
% size restrictions, a shorter form can be supplied by using

% \verb|\icmltitlerunning{...}|

% just before $\mathtt{\backslash begin\{document\}}$.
% Authors using \textbf{Word} must edit the header of the document themselves.

% \section{Format of the Paper}

% All submissions must follow the specified format.

% \subsection{Length and Dimensions}

% Papers must not exceed eight (8) pages, including all figures, tables,
% and appendices, but excluding references and acknowledgements. When references and acknowledgements are included,
% the paper must not exceed ten (10) pages.
% Acknowledgements should be limited to grants and people who contributed to the paper.
% Any submission that exceeds
% this page limit, or that diverges significantly from the specified format,
% will be rejected without review.

% The text of the paper should be formatted in two columns, with an
% overall width of 6.75~inches, height of 9.0~inches, and 0.25~inches
% between the columns. The left margin should be 0.75~inches and the top
% margin 1.0~inch (2.54~cm). The right and bottom margins will depend on
% whether you print on US letter or A4 paper, but all final versions
% must be produced for US letter size.

% The paper body should be set in 10~point type with a vertical spacing
% of 11~points. Please use Times typeface throughout the text.

% \subsection{Title}

% The paper title should be set in 14~point bold type and centered
% between two horizontal rules that are 1~point thick, with 1.0~inch
% between the top rule and the top edge of the page. Capitalize the
% first letter of content words and put the rest of the title in lower
% case.

% \subsection{Author Information for Submission}
% \label{author info}

% ICML uses double-blind review, so author information must not appear. If
% you are using \LaTeX\/ and the \texttt{icml2019.sty} file, use
% \verb+\icmlauthor{...}+ to specify authors and \verb+\icmlaffiliation{...}+ to specify affiliations. (Read the TeX code used to produce this document for an example usage.) The author information
% will not be printed unless \texttt{accepted} is passed as an argument to the
% style file.
% Submissions that include the author information will not
% be reviewed.

% \subsubsection{Self-Citations}

% If you are citing published papers for which you are an author, refer
% to yourself in the third person. In particular, do not use phrases
% that reveal your identity (e.g., ``in previous work \cite{langley00}, we
% have shown \ldots'').

% Do not anonymize citations in the reference section. The only exception are manuscripts that are
% not yet published (e.g., under submission). If you choose to refer to
% such unpublished manuscripts \cite{anonymous}, anonymized copies have
% to be submitted
% as Supplementary Material via CMT\@. However, keep in mind that an ICML
% paper should be self contained and should contain sufficient detail
% for the reviewers to evaluate the work. In particular, reviewers are
% not required to look at the Supplementary Material when writing their
% review.

% \subsubsection{Camera-Ready Author Information}
% \label{final author}

% If a paper is accepted, a final camera-ready copy must be prepared.
% %
% For camera-ready papers, author information should start 0.3~inches below the
% bottom rule surrounding the title. The authors' names should appear in 10~point
% bold type, in a row, separated by white space, and centered. Author names should
% not be broken across lines. Unbolded superscripted numbers, starting 1, should
% be used to refer to affiliations.

% Affiliations should be numbered in the order of appearance. A single footnote
% block of text should be used to list all the affiliations. (Academic
% affiliations should list Department, University, City, State/Region, Country.
% Similarly for industrial affiliations.)

% Each distinct affiliations should be listed once. If an author has multiple
% affiliations, multiple superscripts should be placed after the name, separated
% by thin spaces. If the authors would like to highlight equal contribution by
% multiple first authors, those authors should have an asterisk placed after their
% name in superscript, and the term ``\textsuperscript{*}Equal contribution"
% should be placed in the footnote block ahead of the list of affiliations. A
% list of corresponding authors and their emails (in the format Full Name
% \textless{}email@domain.com\textgreater{}) can follow the list of affiliations.
% Ideally only one or two names should be listed.

% A sample file with author names is included in the ICML2019 style file
% package. Turn on the \texttt{[accepted]} option to the stylefile to
% see the names rendered. All of the guidelines above are implemented
% by the \LaTeX\ style file.

% \subsection{Abstract}

% The paper abstract should begin in the left column, 0.4~inches below the final
% address. The heading `Abstract' should be centered, bold, and in 11~point type.
% The abstract body should use 10~point type, with a vertical spacing of
% 11~points, and should be indented 0.25~inches more than normal on left-hand and
% right-hand margins. Insert 0.4~inches of blank space after the body. Keep your
% abstract brief and self-contained, limiting it to one paragraph and roughly 4--6
% sentences. Gross violations will require correction at the camera-ready phase.

% \subsection{Partitioning the Text}

% You should organize your paper into sections and paragraphs to help
% readers place a structure on the material and understand its
% contributions.

% \subsubsection{Sections and Subsections}

% Section headings should be numbered, flush left, and set in 11~pt bold
% type with the content words capitalized. Leave 0.25~inches of space
% before the heading and 0.15~inches after the heading.

% Similarly, subsection headings should be numbered, flush left, and set
% in 10~pt bold type with the content words capitalized. Leave
% 0.2~inches of space before the heading and 0.13~inches afterward.

% Finally, subsubsection headings should be numbered, flush left, and
% set in 10~pt small caps with the content words capitalized. Leave
% 0.18~inches of space before the heading and 0.1~inches after the
% heading.

% Please use no more than three levels of headings.

% \subsubsection{Paragraphs and Footnotes}

% Within each section or subsection, you should further partition the
% paper into paragraphs. Do not indent the first line of a given
% paragraph, but insert a blank line between succeeding ones.

% You can use footnotes\footnote{Footnotes
% should be complete sentences.} to provide readers with additional
% information about a topic without interrupting the flow of the paper.
% Indicate footnotes with a number in the text where the point is most
% relevant. Place the footnote in 9~point type at the bottom of the
% column in which it appears. Precede the first footnote in a column
% with a horizontal rule of 0.8~inches.\footnote{Multiple footnotes can
% appear in each column, in the same order as they appear in the text,
% but spread them across columns and pages if possible.}

% \subsection{Figures}

% You may want to include figures in the paper to illustrate
% your approach and results. Such artwork should be centered,
% legible, and separated from the text. Lines should be dark and at
% least 0.5~points thick for purposes of reproduction, and text should
% not appear on a gray background.

% Label all distinct components of each figure. If the figure takes the
% form of a graph, then give a name for each axis and include a legend
% that briefly describes each curve. Do not include a title inside the
% figure; instead, the caption should serve this function.

% Number figures sequentially, placing the figure number and caption
% \emph{after} the graphics, with at least 0.1~inches of space before
% the caption and 0.1~inches after it, as in
% Figure~\ref{icml-historical}. The figure caption should be set in
% 9~point type and centered unless it runs two or more lines, in which
% case it should be flush left. You may float figures to the top or
% bottom of a column, and you may set wide figures across both columns
% (use the environment \texttt{figure*} in \LaTeX). Always place
% two-column figures at the top or bottom of the page.

% \subsection{Algorithms}

% If you are using \LaTeX, please use the ``algorithm'' and ``algorithmic''
% environments to format pseudocode. These require
% the corresponding stylefiles, algorithm.sty and
% algorithmic.sty, which are supplied with this package.
% Algorithm~\ref{alg:example} shows an example.

% \begin{algorithm}[tb]
%   \caption{Bubble Sort}
%   \label{alg:example}
% \begin{algorithmic}
%   \STATE {\bfseries Input:} data $x_i$, size $m$
%   \REPEAT
%   \STATE Initialize $noChange = true$.
%   \FOR{$i=1$ {\bfseries to} $m-1$}
%   \IF{$x_i > x_{i+1}$}
%   \STATE Swap $x_i$ and $x_{i+1}$
%   \STATE $noChange = false$
%   \ENDIF
%   \ENDFOR
%   \UNTIL{$noChange$ is $true$}
% \end{algorithmic}
% \end{algorithm}

% \subsection{Tables}

% You may also want to include tables that summarize material. Like
% figures, these should be centered, legible, and numbered consecutively.
% However, place the title \emph{above} the table with at least
% 0.1~inches of space before the title and the same after it, as in
% Table~\ref{sample-table}. The table title should be set in 9~point
% type and centered unless it runs two or more lines, in which case it
% should be flush left.

% % Note use of \abovespace and \belowspace to get reasonable spacing
% % above and below tabular lines.





% \begin{table}[t]
% \caption{Classification accuracies for naive Bayes and flexible
% Bayes on various data sets.}
% \label{sample-table}
% \vskip 0.15in
% \begin{center}
% \begin{small}
% \begin{sc}
% \begin{tabular}{lcccr}
% \toprule
% Data set & Naive & Flexible & Better? \\
% \midrule
% Breast    & 95.9$\pm$ 0.2& 96.7$\pm$ 0.2& $\surd$ \\
% Cleveland & 83.3$\pm$ 0.6& 80.0$\pm$ 0.6& $\times$\\
% Glass2    & 61.9$\pm$ 1.4& 83.8$\pm$ 0.7& $\surd$ \\
% Credit    & 74.8$\pm$ 0.5& 78.3$\pm$ 0.6&         \\
% Horse     & 73.3$\pm$ 0.9& 69.7$\pm$ 1.0& $\times$\\
% Meta      & 67.1$\pm$ 0.6& 76.5$\pm$ 0.5& $\surd$ \\
% Pima      & 75.1$\pm$ 0.6& 73.9$\pm$ 0.5&         \\
% Vehicle   & 44.9$\pm$ 0.6& 61.5$\pm$ 0.4& $\surd$ \\
% \bottomrule
% \end{tabular}
% \end{sc}
% \end{small}
% \end{center}
% \vskip -0.1in
% \end{table}

% Tables contain textual material, whereas figures contain graphical material.
% Specify the contents of each row and column in the table's topmost
% row. Again, you may float tables to a column's top or bottom, and set
% wide tables across both columns. Place two-column tables at the
% top or bottom of the page.

% \subsection{Citations and References}

% Please use APA reference format regardless of your formatter
% or word processor. If you rely on the \LaTeX\/ bibliographic
% facility, use \texttt{natbib.sty} and \texttt{icml2019.bst}
% included in the style-file package to obtain this format.

% Citations within the text should include the authors' last names and
% year. If the authors' names are included in the sentence, place only
% the year in parentheses, for example when referencing Arthur Samuel's
% pioneering work \yrcite{Samuel59}. Otherwise place the entire
% reference in parentheses with the authors and year separated by a
% comma \cite{Samuel59}. List multiple references separated by
% semicolons \cite{kearns89,Samuel59,mitchell80}. Use the `et~al.'
% construct only for citations with three or more authors or after
% listing all authors to a publication in an earlier reference \cite{MachineLearningI}.

% Authors should cite their own work in the third person
% in the initial version of their paper submitted for blind review.
% Please refer to Section~\ref{author info} for detailed instructions on how to
% cite your own papers.

% Use an unnumbered first-level section heading for the references, and use a
% hanging indent style, with the first line of the reference flush against the
% left margin and subsequent lines indented by 10 points. The references at the
% end of this document give examples for journal articles \cite{Samuel59},
% conference publications \cite{langley00}, book chapters \cite{Newell81}, books
% \cite{DudaHart2nd}, edited volumes \cite{MachineLearningI}, technical reports
% \cite{mitchell80}, and dissertations \cite{kearns89}.

% Alphabetize references by the surnames of the first authors, with
% single author entries preceding multiple author entries. Order
% references for the same authors by year of publication, with the
% earliest first. Make sure that each reference includes all relevant
% information (e.g., page numbers).

% Please put some effort into making references complete, presentable, and
% consistent. If using bibtex, please protect capital letters of names and
% abbreviations in titles, for example, use \{B\}ayesian or \{L\}ipschitz
% in your .bib file.

% \subsection{Software and Data}

% We strongly encourage the publication of software and data with the
% camera-ready version of the paper whenever appropriate. This can be
% done by including a URL in the camera-ready copy. However, do not
% include URLs that reveal your institution or identity in your
% submission for review. Instead, provide an anonymous URL or upload
% the material as ``Supplementary Material'' into the CMT reviewing
% system. Note that reviewers are not required to look at this material
% when writing their review.

% % Acknowledgements should only appear in the accepted version.
% \section*{Acknowledgements}

% \textbf{Do not} include acknowledgements in the initial version of
% the paper submitted for blind review.

% If a paper is accepted, the final camera-ready version can (and
% probably should) include acknowledgements. In this case, please
% place such acknowledgements in an unnumbered section at the
% end of the paper. Typically, this will include thanks to reviewers
% who gave useful comments, to colleagues who contributed to the ideas,
% and to funding agencies and corporate sponsors that provided financial
% support.


% % In the unusual situation where you want a paper to appear in the
% % references without citing it in the main text, use \nocite
% \nocite{langley00}

% \bibliography{example_paper}
% \bibliographystyle{icml2019}

% \appendix
% \section{Do \emph{not} have an appendix here}

% \textbf{\emph{Do not put content after the references.}}
% %
% Put anything that you might normally include after the references in a separate
% supplementary file.

% We recommend that you build supplementary material in a separate document.
% If you must create one PDF and cut it up, please be careful to use a tool that
% doesn't alter the margins, and that doesn't aggressively rewrite the PDF file.
% pdftk usually works fine. 

% \textbf{Please do not use Apple's preview to cut off supplementary material.} In
% previous years it has altered margins, and created headaches at the camera-ready
% stage.
