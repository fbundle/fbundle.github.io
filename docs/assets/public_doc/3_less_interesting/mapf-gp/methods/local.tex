\subsection{Local Search}

The authors \cite{vandermeulen2019balanced} introduced two local search operations: $transfer$ and $swap$. $transfer$ is the operation that moves a node from one partition to another partition. $swap$ is the operation that exchanges two nodes from a pair of partitions.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\caption{Local Search}
\label{algo:localsearch}
\textbf{Input:}:

    Initial $K$ partitions
    
    Strategy $\in$ \{ first, best \} 
    
    Objective function

\textbf{Output:}:

    Final $K$ partitions
    
\textbf{Procedure:}:

While true:

    \hspace{1cm} var candidate\_set = []

    \hspace{1cm} For operation in all possible operations:
    
        \hspace{2cm} Calculate the gain of the operation
            
        \hspace{2cm} If the gain is positive:
            
            \hspace{3cm} Push the operation and gain to candidate set
                
            \hspace{3cm} If Strategy is first:
                
                \hspace{4cm} break
                
    \hspace{1cm} If candidate\_set is empty:
    
        \hspace{2cm} break
    
    \hspace{1cm} Pick the best candidate, update the current $K$ partitions
    
return current $K$ partitions

\end{algorithm}

The algorithm \ref{algo:localsearch} is capable to use with the two proposed operations to approximately find our solution. 


\subsubsection{test4}

Strategy: first

\[
O_4 = O_0 = max\{C_a^{(k)}\}_{k=1}^{K}
\]

\subsubsection{test8}

Strategy: first

\[
O_8 = \sum_{k=1}^{K} C_a^{(k)}
\]
