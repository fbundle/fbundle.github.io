\section{NOETHERIAN RING}

\begin{definition}[Noetherian ring]
	Given a ring $A$, the following are equivalent
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Ascending chain condition (ADC): every chain of ideals in $A$ stablizes
		$$
			I_1 \subseteq I_2 \subseteq I_3 ...
		$$
		
		That is, $I_n = I_{n+1}$  for large $n$
		
		\item Every ideal $I$ in $A$ is finitely generated
		
		\item For any $A$-modules $N$ and $M$ so that $N \subseteq M$, $M$ is finitely generated implies $N$ is finitely generated
	\end{enumerate}
	
	A ring $A$ satisfies one of those conditons is called Noetherian ring.
\end{definition}

\begin{longproof}
	($1 \implies 2$) Suppose an ideal $I$ of $A$ is not finitely generated, there exists a sequence $a_1, a_2, a_3, ... \in I$ that generate $I$, that is, $I = (a_1, a_2, a_3, ...)$, then there exists a chain
	$$
	(a_1) \subseteq (a_1, a_2) \subseteq (a_1, a_2, a_3) \subseteq ... \subseteq I
	$$
	
	so that infinitely many number of inclusions are strict.
	
	($2 \implies 3$) Induction of minimal number of generators of $M$
	
	If $M$ is generated by $1$ element, namely $m$, then any element in $M$ can be written by $am$ for some $a \in A$. The map 
	\begin{align*}
		\phi: A &\to M \\
		a &\mapsto am
	\end{align*}
	
	is a surjective $A$-module morphism, then $M \cong A / \ker \phi$. $\ker \phi$ is a submodule of $A$ as $A$-module and also an ideal of $A$ be cause if $r \in A$ and $a \in \ker \phi$, then 
	$$
	\phi(ra) = r \phi(a) = 0
	$$
	Hence, $M \cong A / I$ for some ideal $I$ of $A$. Now, any submodule $N$ in $M$ corresponds to an ideal in $A / I$ and any ideal in $A / I$ corresponds to an ideal $J$ in $A$ containing $I$. Since $J$ is finitely generated, then $J / I$ in $A / I$ is finitely generated, then $N$ is also finitely generated.	
	
	Suppose $2 \implies 3$ for every number of generators $1, 2, ..., n-1$ of $M$. If $M$ is generated by $\set{x_1, x_2, ..., x_n}$, let $M_1$ be the submodule generated by $x_1$, then $M / M_1$ is generated by $\set{\bar{x}_2, ..., \bar{x}_n}$. Let $N$ be a submodule of $M$, then the following two sequences are exact
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tikzcd}
			0 \arrow[r] & N \cap M_1 \arrow[r] \arrow[d, hook] & N \arrow[r] \arrow[d, hook] & N / (N \cap M_1) \arrow[r] \arrow[d, hook] & 0 \\
			0 \arrow[r] & M_1 \arrow[r]                        & M \arrow[r]                 & M / M_1 \arrow[r]                          & 0
		\end{tikzcd}
	\end{center}
	
	$N \cap M_1$ is finitely generated since it is a submodule of $M_1$ which is generated by $1$ elements. $N / (N \cap M_1)$ is finitely generated since it is a submodule of $M / M_1$ which is generated by $n-1$ elements. Hence $N$ is finitely generated due to exactness of the top sequence.
	
	($3 \implies 1$) Given a chain of ideals
	$$
	I_1 \subseteq I_2 \subseteq I_3 ...
	$$
	
	Then $I = \bigcup_{n \in \N} I_n$ is also an ideal. Ideals in $A$ are the submodules of $A$ as an $A$-module. Therefore, $A$ is finitely generated as an $A$-module implies $I$ is finitely generated as an $A$-module which is also finitely generated as an ideal. Let
	$$
	I = \inner{x_1, x_2, ..., x_m}
	$$
	
	Each $x_i \in \set{x_1, x_2, ..., x_m}$ belong to some $I_n$ in $I_1, I_2, I_3 ...$, let $I_N$ be the the smallest ideal in the chain containing $\set{x_1, x_2, ..., x_m}$. Then
	$$
	I = \inner{x_1, x_2, ..., x_m} \subseteq I_N \subseteq I
	$$
	
	Hence, $I_{n} = I_{n+1}$ for all $n \geq N$
\end{longproof}

\begin{remark}
	Some examples of Noetherian rings
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $\Z$ is Noetherian, all fields are Noetherian
		\item If $A$ is Noetherian and $I$ is an an ideal of $A$, then $A / I$ is Noetherian
		\item If $A$ is Noetherian and $S$ is a multiplicatively closed subset of $A$, then $S^{-1} A$ is Noetherian
	\end{enumerate}
\end{remark}

\begin{longproof}
	(2) one to one correspondence between ideals of $A / I$ and ideal of $A$ containing $I$
	
	(3) Any ideal $I$ of $S^{-1} A$ is extended from ideal $J$ of $A$ which is finitely generated, if $J = (x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)$, then $I = \tuple*{\frac{x_1}{1}, \frac{x_2}{s}, ..., \frac{x_n}{1}}$
\end{longproof}


\begin{theorem}[Hilbert basis theorem]
	If $A$ is a Noetherian ring, then $A[x]$ is also Noetherian
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
	If a nonzero ideal $I$ in $A[x]$ is not finitely generated, we inductively construct $f_0(x), f_1(x), f_2(x), ... \in A[x]$ and ideals $I_n = (f_0(x), f_1(x), ..., f_n(x))$ as follows:
	
	Pick a nonzero polynomial $f_0(x) \in I$ of minimal degree, set
	$$
	I_0 = (f_0(x))
	$$
	
	If we already picked $f_0(x), f_1(x), ..., f_{n-1}(x)$, pick a nonzero polynomial $f_n(x) \in I - I_{n-1}$ of minimal degree, set
	$$
	I_n = (f_0(x), f_1(x), ..., f_n(x))
	$$
	
	By construction, the sequence of degrees of $f_0(x), f_1(x), f_2(x), ...$ is non-decreasing, that is
	$$
	\deg f_0(x) \leq \deg f_1(x) \leq \deg f_2(x) \leq ...
	$$
	
	Let $a_n \in A$ be the leading coefficient of $f_n(x)$ and $J \subseteq A$ be the ideal
	$$
	J = (a_0, a_1, a_2, ...)
	$$
	
	Since $A$ is Noetherian, $J$ is finitely generated, hence
	$$
	J = (a_0, a_1, ..., a_{N-1})
	$$
	
	for some $N \in \N$. Thus,
	$$
	a_N = \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} y_i a_i
	$$
	
	for some $y_1, y_2, ..., y_{N-1} \in A$. Consider the polynomial
	$$
	g(x) = \sum_{i=1}^{N-1} y_i x^{\deg f_N(x) - \deg f_i(x)} f_i(x) = a_N x^{\deg f_N(x)} + h(x)
	$$
	
	where $\deg h(x) < \deg f_N(x)$. Since $g(x)$ is a $A[x]$-linear combination of $f_i(x)$, $g(x) \in I_{N-1}$. $f(x) \notin I_{N-1}$, then $f_N(x) - g(x) \notin I_{N-1}$. This is a contradiction of minimality of degree of $f_N(x)$ because $f_N(x) - g(x) \notin I_{N-1}$ and $\deg(f_N(x) - g(x)) < \deg f_N(x)$
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
	If $A$ is Noetherian, then $A[x_1, x_2, ..., x_n]$ is also Noetherian
\end{corollary}

\begin{remark}
	If $A$ is Noetherian, then the power series ring $A[[x]]$ is also Noetherian
\end{remark}

\begin{proof}
	\note{HW}
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}[finitely generated algebra, finite presented algebra]
	Let $A$ be a ring and $B$ be an $A$-algebra. $B$ is called finite generated (or finite type) as an $A$-algebra if the inclusion $A \to A[x_1, x_2, ..., x_n]$ factors through $B$
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tikzcd}
			& {A[x_1, x_2, ..., x_n]} \arrow[d, two heads] \\
			A \arrow[ru, hook] \arrow[r] & B                                           
		\end{tikzcd}
	\end{center}
	
	That is, there exists an isomorphism $B \cong \frac{A[x_1, x_2, ..., x_n]}{I}$ for some ideal $I$ of $A[x_1, x_2, ..., x_n]$. If moreover, $I$ is a finitely generated as an $A[x_1, x_2, ..., x_n]$-module, $B$ is called finitely presented $A$-algbera.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
	If $A$ is Notherian, then any finitely generated $A$-algebra is Noetherian.
\end{proposition}

\section{A PREVIEW OF DIMENSION THEORY}

\begin{definition}[height, Krull dimension]
	Given a prime ideal $\mf{p}$ of a ring $A$, define the height of $\mf{p}$ by
	$$
	\hgt \mf{p} = \sup \set{n \geq 0: \text{ there exists a chain of prime ideals } (0) = \mf{p}_0 \subsetneq \mf{p}_1 \subsetneq \mf{p}_2 \subsetneq ... \subsetneq \mf{p}_n = \mf{p}}
	$$
	
	The dimension of $A$ is defined by
	$$
	\dim A = \sup_{\mf{p} \text{ prime in } A} \hgt \mf{p}
	$$
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
	Some examples of dimension
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $\dim k = 0$ for any field $k$
		\item $\dim \Z = 1$ ($\hgt \mf{p} = 1$ for any prime $\mf{p}$ in $\Z$)
		\item $\dim k[x_1, x_2, ..., x_n] \geq n$ for any field $k$ ($(x_1) \subsetneq (x_1, x_2) \subsetneq ... \subsetneq (x_1, x_2, .., x_n)$)
	\end{enumerate}
\end{remark}

\begin{theorem}
	If $A$ is Noetherian, then
	$$
		\dim A[x] = \dim A + 1
	$$
	
	\note{will be proved in chapter dimension theory}
\end{theorem}

\begin{remark}
	If $A$ is Noetherian, then $\hgt \mf{p}$ is finite for any prime ideal $\mf{p}$ of $A$. However, $\dim A$ can be infinite (Nagata 50s)
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
	If $A$ is not Noetherian and $\dim A$ is finite, then
	$$
	\dim A + 1 \leq \dim A[x] \leq 2 \dim A
	$$
	
	There are examples exhibiting every possibility of this range
\end{remark}
