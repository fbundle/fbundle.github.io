	\large \textit{
		this is my notes for MA5204 Commutative and Homological Algbera.
		growing up hating algebra, recently I started to appreciate the beauty of algebra.
		16/01/2024, I overcomed my fear, my shyness, my anxiety, I asked my teacher to enrol me in an graduate algebra class.
		this course is taught by Assoc Professor David Hansen (and his postdoc Alexander Youcis and Finn Wiersig on chapter9\_morering, chapter10\_projective\_module) in NUS AY2024-2025.
		The main reference of the course is  (1) Atiyah Macdonald - Introduction to Commutative Algebra, (2) Matsumura - Commutative Ring Theory, and (3) Matsumura - Commutative Algebra
