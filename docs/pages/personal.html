                            beside the interest in mathematics, I started spending my free time for running since the middle of October 2023.

                            <b>math story 1</b>
                            <br>
                            I used to be a physics student and absolutely hate math (mostly infuenced by physics friends and teachers). Turn out, math is probably the only thing I am good at and it gives me some sense of beauty and discovery.
                            In my third year of Computer Science degree, I started reading the book Michael Sipser - Introduction to the Theory of Computation, that was the first time I knew what math is. Not solving non-sense equations, inequalities.
                            <i>math is seek to understand nature</i>. At the same time, I started reading Sheldon Axler - Linear Algebra Done Right, my first proper math book.
                            When I graduated from university (2021), I started being a software engineer, COVID-19 hit, later on had a girlfriend, I don't really have any time left for my own interests.
                            Two years later (2023), I broke up with my girlfriend due to not able to align our life goals. I wasted another half a year to recover. 
                            During the time, I also read math books (Stephen Abbott - Understanding Analysis, Dan Saracino - Abstract Algebra: A First Course, Dummit Foote - Abstract Algebra, Sidney A. Morris - Topology without tears) but not very much.
                            I applied for MSc in Math in NUS for the first time (Aug 2022), got rejected (I was so stressed at the time, and my girlfriend was not appeared to be supportive).
                            I applied for MSc in Math in NUS for the second time (May 2023), got accepted - this was probably the happiest moment in my life.
                            Here I am, two years later (Apr 2025), writing this while doing commutative algebra last homework and preparing for my last final exam in NUS.

                            <br>
                            growing up hating algebra, recently I started to appreciate the beauty of algebra.
                            16/01/2024, I overcomed my fear, my shyness, my anxiety (which is REALLY REALLY hard for me) I asked my teacher to enrol me in an graduate algebra class.

                            Here is a quote from a person I admire: <i>"Don't be nervous"</i>. 
                            I was always a person who is afraid of everything to the point that I have many syumptoms of anxiety.
                            I searched on reddit and people said NOONE HAS TIME FOR THAT. I guess they were right, noone has time for a person who keeps doubting themself.
                            Maybe the cure is just telling/hypnotizing myself <i>"Don't be nervous"</i>
