<h1>Book</h1>

List of Math and Computer Science books and courses I have taken over the years
<hr>
<h2>Point-Set Topology (from Category Theory point of view ) </h2>
<p>
    Tai-Danae Bradley, Tyler Bryson, John Terilla - Topology: A Categorical Approach
    <br>
    The book is a refresh in point-set topology and homotopy, hence, readers are expected to know what's happening.
    Explanations might not be the easiest to follow but sufficient for determined people.
    Overall, must read book.

<h2>Algebraic Topology I</h2>
<p>
    Supplements:
    <br>
    Allen Hatcher - Algebraic Topology
    <br>
    MIT OpenCourseWare - Algebraic Topology I
    <br>
    Roman Sauer - Algebraic Topology youtube series
    <br>
    This is the most difficult as well as the most beautiful mathematical course I have ever taken.
    Algebraic Topology (AT) uses tools from Category Theory (CT), Homological Algbera (HA) to study topological objects.
    While the Hatcher's book focuses more on geometric approach to AT, Dr. Charmaine Sia's approach to AT is more abstract, explaining everything by abstraction from CT and HA.
    The approach is wellrounded, covers many aspects of the subject, without her introduction, I would never be able to grasp any idea from AT.
    The course includes Homology, Cohomology, Cup Product, Fundamental Group, van Kampen theorem, Covering Spaces
    For further references, one should benefit from reading MIT OpenCourseWare AT I notes (for exercises), Roman Sauer AT youtube series (for HA approach to AT)

<h2>Point-Set Topology</h2>
<p>
    Sidney A. Morris - Topology without tears
    <br>
    James Munkres - Topology
    <br>
    My first experience with topology.
    Coming up with the notion and defintion in topology is unintuitive and requires years of refinement.
    It often requires a significant amount of time doing exercise to have the sense of what happening.
    <br>
    A solid basic set theory is required.
    <br>
    The book consists of several parts: (1) notion of continuous mapping, open mapping, homeomorphism, subspace, metric space (2) topological properties: open, closed, connected, compact (3) embedding theorem (4) product topology abd Tychonoff theorem (5) quotient space

<h2>Abstract Algebra</h2>
<p>
    Dan Saracino - Abstract Algebra: A First Course
    <br>
    Dummit, David Steven, and Richard M. Foote - Abstract Algebra (Chapter 1 to Chapter 5)
    <br>
    A book on discrete structure: groups and rings. Some ideas about number theory is required.
    Algebra is highly abstract and complex, however, it will be intuitive if one dedicates time on it

<h2>Complex Analysis</h2>
<p>
    Dr. Michael Penn's Youtube Series on Complex Analysis <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVMgvCDIRy1wzJcFNGw7t4tehgzhFtBpm">here</a>
    <br>
    Complex numbers,
    Sequence - Limit - Derivative,
    Cauchy-Riemann Equation,
    Conformal Mapping - Mobius Transformation,
    Gauss's Mean Value Property - Maximum Modulus,
    Riemann Integeration for Complex numbers,
    Cauchy's Integral Formula - Lioville's Theorem,
    Morena's Theorem,
    Complex Green's Theorem,
    Sequence of Complex functions,
    Taylor Series - Zeroes of Analytic functions,
    Laurent Decomposition/Series,

    <br>
    Feels like a vector calculus courses on the multiplication of complex numbers. Misterious

<h2>Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos</h2>
<p>
    Steven Strogatz - Nonlinear Dynamics And Chaos: With Applications To Physics, Biology, Chemistry, And Engineering
    <br>
    A pleasant introduction to nonlinear dynamics and chaos. The book focuses on graphical methods and high level ideas.
    <br>
    Downside: Too much non-mathematical details. Most students don't need to understand the mechanisms of reproduction in biology, mass preservation in physics, or chemical equations in chemistry.

<h2>Introduction to Functional Analysis</h2>
<p>
    <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-102-introduction-to-functional-analysis-spring-2021/pages/lecture-notes-and-readings/">
        18.102 | Spring 2021 | Undergraduate
        Introduction to Functional Analysis
    </a>
    <br>
    Analysis is the study of limit and its corollaries. Functional Analysis is the course on limits of sequence of functions. Once in a library, I wanted to refresh my skills, I tried to derive Fourier Transform from the Hibert space L^2 with sinusoids basis but realized that I never taken any function analysis course. The course introduces concept of Banach space, Ïƒ-algebra, Borel set, Algbemeasurable set on reals, measurable functions on reals, Hibert Space.

<h2>Real Analysis</h2>
<p>
    Stephen Abbott - Understanding Analysis
    <br>
    Walter Rudin - Principles of Mathematical Analysis
    <br>
    Analysis is the study of limit and its corollaries. Real Analysis is the course on limits of sequence of reals. What I was impressed the most from this course is the concept and limit and infinity on reals. The book is like a journey explaining many concepts for real numbers. And at the end, Abbott gave readers a little gift on the construction real numbers. It's like the twist in a movie, after that they all make sense.

<h2>Linear Algebra</h2>
<p>
    Sheldon Axler - Linear Algbera Done Right
    <br>
    Beside Sipser's book, this is my second most favorite textbook and also my first proper Mathematics textbook. The book is a sequence of true statements with explainations. They're just too beautiful of a construction. The pure math textbook for linear algebra, built up from the concepts of vector space and invariant subspace to trace and determinant. the must read 2nd book in linear algebra. Different from Computer Science, Mathematics has a kind of existential proof that does not require to construct an example. (Similar to the concept of certificate in Computer Science)

<h2>Theory of Computation, Complexity Theory</h2>
<p>
    Introduction to the theory of computation - Michael Sipser
    <br>
    Recommended by Dr. Zinovi Rabinovich. I studied this book at the same time with Advanced Topics in Algorithms. The Sipser's book really openned my mind about theoretical computer science. Really satisfied with the rigorousness of concepts in computer science, this was the first time I really know what mathematicians do. The book covers most basic concepts about automata theory, computability theory and complexity theory with rigorous proofs

<h2>Advanced Topics in Algorithms</h2>
<p>
    Cormen, Thomas H and Leiserson, Charles E and Rivest, Ronald L and Stein, Clifford - Introduction to algorithms
    <br>
    Dr. Zinovi Rabinovich inspired me a lot in this course. The course is about construction of all concepts and theoretical guarantee of all algorithms in Computer Science. I was a Physics student in high school, Mathematics for me is just a bunch of unneccessary non-sense mostly due to the way they teached Mathematics in my secondary school. At the time, I thought Physics is the way of describing nature, describing everything. But after this course, I really surpised on how perfect everything is in Theoretical Computer Science is. They are just beautiful.
