In essence, Paxos achieves fault‑tolerant consensus by orchestrating a two‑phase interaction between proposers and acceptors, backed by a straightforward inductive safety proof.)</div>

Uniform Construction from Binary Expansions * Define \(Y_n=\sum_{k=1}^n X_k/2^k\) from IID fair bits \(X_k\). * As \(n\to\infty\), \(Y_n\) converges almost surely to a uniform random variable on \([0,1]\); the construction is essentially interpreting the infinite binary expansion as a real number. These solutions illustrate common probabilistic tools—indicator algebra, conditioning, generating functions, combinatorial counting, and martingale/difference equations—and showcase subtle distinctions between pairwise independence, zero covariance, and full independence. They also demonstrate classic limit theorems (law of large numbers, central limit theorem, Poisson/exponential approximations) in concrete settings.)</div>

Setting the second fundamental form equal to zero yields conditions that force the coordinate curves \(u=\text{const}\) or \(v=\text{const}\) to satisfy the asymptotic equation. Hence the coordinate lines themselves are asymptotic trajectories on the surface. These problems collectively illustrate how differential‐geometric tools—Gauss maps, shape operators, Euler’s theorem, and curvature estimates—enable concrete computations and qualitative conclusions about surface behaviour.)</div>

Integrating over \(D\) yields the familiar formula A(D)=\iint_{D}\sqrt{1+f_{x}^{2}(x,y)+f_{y}^{2}(x,y)}\,dx\,dy . ### Lemma – Normal Vector from Gradient If a regular surface is given implicitly by \(F(x,y,z)=0\), then the unit normal vector at a point is the normalised gradient \(\nabla F/|\nabla F|\). This observation underpins the orthogonality check in Problem 4 and simplifies computations of normals for implicit surfaces.)</div>

Concretely, for every \(\varepsilon>0\) there exists \(\delta>0\) such that whenever \(d_X(x,y)<\delta\), we have \(d_Y(f(x),f(y))<\varepsilon\).

The curvature formula for a parametrised curve is \kappa(t)=\frac{\|\mathbf{r}'(t)\times\mathbf{r}''(t)\|}{\|\mathbf{r}'(t)\|^{3}} .

For locally compact Hausdorff \(X,Z\) and arbitrary \(Y\) an isomorphism \mathrm{Top}(Z\times X,Y)\;\cong\;\mathrm{Top}(Z,Y^{X}) is established, showing that the exponential law extends to this enriched setting.

Lemma* > Let \((X,\le)\) be a non‑empty poset in which every chain (i.e., every totally ordered subset) possesses an upper bound in \(X\). Then \(X\) contains at least one maximal element. In practice, Zorn’s Lemma is employed via a constructive strategy: take any chain, find its upper bound, and use the hypothesis to guarantee existence of a maximal element. It is equivalent (over ZFC) to the Well‑Ordering Theorem and the Axiom of Choice, making it indispensable for proving existence statements—such as the existence of bases for vector spaces, maximal ideals in rings, or well‑orderings of arbitrary sets—without explicitly constructing them.)</div>

The argument exploits the fact that the second fundamental form vanishes, forcing the mixed curvature components \(R(v,w,N)\) to vanish, which together with the previous lemma yields the constant‑curvature conclusion. **Takeaway.** The document demonstrates how elementary differential‑geometric calculations—Jacobian determinants, covariant derivatives, trace identities—can establish deep structural facts about Riemannian manifolds, such as the necessity of a special metric for a radial projection to become a submersion, explicit identities among standard operators, and characterizations of constant curvature via orthogonal curvature relations and totally geodesic submanifolds.)</div>

Thus sections that vanish at \(x\) form a submodule whose quotient recovers the usual fibre. - This construction mirrors the function case: one replaces the algebra of functions by the module of sections, and the maximal ideal by the submodule of vanishing sections. **Key takeaway:** By treating smooth manifolds as locally ringed spaces—rings of functions, maximal ideals, localizations, and residue fields—one can recover familiar geometric notions (points, germs, fibres) purely algebraically. The same framework applies uniformly to modules of sections of vector bundles, showing how commutative‑algebra techniques encode differential‑topological data.)</div>
