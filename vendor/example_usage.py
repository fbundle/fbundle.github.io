        Due: September 15, 2024
        
        Problem 1: Let V be a vector space over a field F. Prove that if v1, v2, ..., vn are linearly independent vectors in V, then any subset of these vectors is also linearly independent.
        
        Problem 2: Consider the matrix A = [1 2; 3 4]. Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A.
        
        Problem 3: Let T: V -> W be a linear transformation. Show that ker(T) is a subspace of V.
        
        Problem 4: Let A be an n√ón matrix. Prove that if A¬≤ = A, then A is diagonalizable.

        Chapter 1: Complex Numbers and Functions
        
        We begin with the study of complex numbers, which form a field that extends the real numbers. A complex number z = x + iy where x, y are real numbers and i¬≤ = -1.
        
        The Cauchy-Riemann equations are fundamental to complex analysis:
        ‚àÇu/‚àÇx = ‚àÇv/‚àÇy
        ‚àÇu/‚àÇy = -‚àÇv/‚àÇx
        
        These equations must be satisfied for a function f(z) = u(x,y) + iv(x,y) to be differentiable.

        Chapter 2: Schemes
        
        A scheme is a locally ringed space (X, OX) which is locally isomorphic to Spec A for some commutative ring A. The structure sheaf OX gives us a way to define regular functions on X.
        
        Key concepts include:
        - Affine schemes
        - Sheaves and presheaves
        - Morphisms of schemes
        - Projective schemes
        
        The Zariski topology plays a crucial role in algebraic geometry.
        
        Chapter 3: First Properties of Schemes
        
        We study various properties of schemes including:

        - Dimension theory
